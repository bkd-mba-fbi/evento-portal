## Hotfix Release

Remark: To create a hotfix for an issue in the _webapp-schulverwaltung_ repository, consider the instructions in [Hotfix webapp-schulverwaltung
](./hotfix-webapp-schulverwaltung.md).

1. Create a hotfix branch named `hotfix/1234-short-description` from the `production` branch (with `1234` being the issue number and `short-description` being a summary of the purpose of the branch).

1. Test hotfix on your environment.

1. Commit your fixes to the hotfix branch, then push the hotfix branch.

1. In the tab bar of the GitHub project select _Actions_:<br>![Release Workflow](assets/images/release_step_1.png)

1. When finished, the [package repository](https://github.com/bkd-mba-fbi/evento-portal/pkgs/container/evento-portal) should look similar to the following screenshot:<br>![Hotfix Releases](assets/images/hotfix.png)

1. Now your hotfix will be deploy automatic to test and production.

1. To complete the process, you have to merge back the hotfix changes to `production`, `test` and `main`, or otherwise they would be missing in the next (regular or hotfix) release.

   1. Merge the hotfix branch into `production`:

      ```
      git checkout production
      git merge hotfix/1234-short-description
      git push
      ```

   1. Merge the hotfix branch into `test`:

      ```
      git checkout test
      git merge hotfix/1234-short-description
      git push
      ```

   1. Merge the hotfix branch into `main`:

      ```
      git checkout main
      git merge hotfix/1234-short-description
      # Resolve possible merge conflicts & `git commit` them...
      git push
      ```

1. Finally, you can delete the hotfix branch.
